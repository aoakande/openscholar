## Overview

OpenScholar is a blockchain-powered ecosystem designed to revolutionize academic research and collaboration. Built on the Stacks blockchain, OpenScholar aims to create a decentralized platform for open access to academic papers, transparent peer review processes, and direct funding of research projects.

Our mission is to democratize access to knowledge, foster global collaboration among researchers, and create a more efficient and transparent academic publishing system.
